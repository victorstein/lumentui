Updated tests to verify new interval behavior (21 tests, all passing)\n\n**Technical details:**\n- Poll interval now reads from LUMENTUI_POLL_INTERVAL config (default: 60 seconds)\n- Uses setInterval with milliseconds for precise control\n- Properly registers and unregisters intervals with SchedulerRegistry\n- Maintains existing retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff via axios-retry)\n- Daemon already survives network failures and continues polling\n\n**Result:**\nThe daemon now respects the configured poll interval and will retry at that same interval after network failures, instead of being hardcoded to 1 minute."}
